# SocialAppWithExpress4

**Status:** Work is still in progress

**Authentication Approach:** <br />
We require an email and password as primary authentication strategy. User can authenticate using Facebook, Twitter or Google+, but as soon as they are authenticated with social strategies the app will require them to add an email and password to complete user sign up. <br />
Users can also link Social Strategies once they have signed up using Email and Password. Once they are logged in they can connect Social Strategies in order to login using them.

**Coming Features in the Next Update:** <br />
In the future we will add username and phone number verification to login or signup.
Forgot password system coming up.
